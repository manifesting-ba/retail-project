‚úí **Observations**:
- **Sales Recovery**: After a slight dip in 2023, total sales bounced back in 2024, reaching $524,881, increasing by 6.8% from 2023 to 2024.
- **Rising Customer Activity**: Transactions and quantity sold also peaked in 2024, signaling enhanced customer engagement.
- **Stable Customer Spend**: Average spend per transaction remained stable, hovering around $130 ‚Äî this suggests growth came from increased volume and purchase frequency.

üìç **Insight**: The data reveals a slight dip in 2023 followed by a **clear rebound** in 2024. Sales, transactions, and quantity sold all increased, suggesting a **potential recovery phase** ‚Äî possibly due to post-pandemic normalization or improved consumer demand. However, additional context is needed to confirm causality.

‚úí **Observations**:
- **Clear Seasonality**: Spending and transactions exhibit clear seasonal trends, with noticeable **peaks in late Q4** (Nov-Dec) and **around mid-year** ‚Äî likely aligned with holiday shopping and summer events.
- **Post-peak Declines**: A **sharp drop follows each peak season**, especially at the **start of the year** (Jan-Feb), indicating a slowdown in consumer activity.

üí° **Recommendations**:

### üë© Customer Behavior Analysis

<img width="1287" height="626" alt="Correlation between Customer Spending and Number of Transactions" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/89386006-04af-4a25-b792-808381705e68" />

‚úí **Observations**:
- There is a **moderately strong positive correlation** between the number of transactions and customer spending. Customers with both high transaction counts and high average spend per transaction are top contributors to revenue.
- However, the relationship is not perfectly linear since customers with similar transaction counts can have noticeably different spending levels, highlighting the role of other factors like average spend per transaction.

<img width="1335" height="644" alt="Correlation between Customer Spending and Number of Transactions (2)" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/20f9454c-d5fa-4a64-aca8-f125b6cf796b" />

- Key Opportunity Segments:
  - High-Value Customers: (CUST_02, CUST_04, CUST_21, CUST_22, CUST_03, CUST_19)
    - CUST_02, CUST_04, CUST_21, CUST_22 (Orange group): These customers have high average spend per transaction, indicating their willingness to pay, but they don't buy frequently.
    - The same goes for CUST_03 and CUST_19 (Red group): Their averages spend per transaction rank among the highest; however, their total spend is low. This is simply because they don‚Äôt buy often enough.
  - Frequent Buyers: (CUST_01, CUST_09, CUST_11)
    - CUST_01, CUST_09: Higher-than-median transactions (485 and 498 respectively) but lowest averages spend per transaction, leading to lower total spending.
    - CUST_11: CUST_11 makes a similar number of transactions as peers (481) but generates $61K total spend ‚Äî below CUST_10 ($63K) and CUST_23 ($65K) ‚Äî due to a lower average spend per transaction ($126.26 compared to $131.30 and $134.11).

üí° **Recommendations**:
- **Increase Purchase Frequency for High-Value Customers**: (CUST_02, CUST_04, CUST_21, CUST_22, CUST_03, CUST_19)
  - Offer personalized product recommendations based on past purchases to spark interest.
  - Give bonus points or perks for making a certain number of purchases within a set time frame.
  - Offer flash sales or weekly deals to encourage more visits.
  - Send targeted promos tied to holiday seasons or personal occasions (birthdays, anniversaries).
- **Increase Average Spend per Transaction for Frequent Buyers**: (CUST_01, CUST_09, CUST_11)
  - Train staff (offline) and optimize website prompts (online) to suggest higher-value or complementary items.
  - Offer ‚Äúspend more, earn more‚Äù rewards ‚Äî e.g., extra loyalty points or cashback for purchases above a set spend threshold.
