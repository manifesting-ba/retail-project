# RETAIL SALES ANALYSIS SQL PROJECT
## üéØ Objective
The objective of this project is to explore sales trends, assess product category performance, and understand customer purchasing behavior. The insights derived from this analysis aim to support data-driven decision-making for marketing strategies and inventory management.
## üìÅ Dataset Overview
- **Source**: [Kaggle - Retail sales dataset](retail_store_sales.csv)
- **License**: CC BY-SA 4.0 License
- **Time range**: January 2022 - January 2025
- **Size**: 12,575 rows x 11 columns
- **Key features**:
  - Transaction ID, Customer ID
  - Category, Item, Price Per Unit
  - Quantity, Total Spent
  - Payment Method, Location, Transaction Date, Discount Applied
### ‚ö† Caveats:
- Partial Month (January 2025):
  - Data for January 2025 is incomplete and may distort trends or monthly comparisons. It should be excluded from time-based analysis unless specifically accounted for.
- Synthetic Data:
  - The dataset is artificially generated for analysis purposes. While it mimics real-world structures and distributions, it may not fully reflect actual customer behavior, seasonality, or market dynamics.
## üßπ Data cleaning 
The data cleaning process was performed using SQL, and the full set of queries can be found in [data_cleaning.sql](data_cleaning.sql) . 
Key steps included:
- Standardization
- Duplicates removal
- Missing value handling
The total row count after cleaning is 11,971 rows
## üîé Exploratory data analysis

- **Observations**:
  - **Sales Recovery**: After a slight dip in 2023, total sales bounced back in 2024, reaching $524,881, increasing by 6.8% from 2023 to 2024.
  - **Rising Customer Activity**: Transactions and quantity sold also peaked in 2024, signaling enhanced customer engagement.
  - **Stable Customer Spend**: Average spend per transaction remained stable, hovering around $130 ‚Äî this suggests growth came from increased volume and purchase frequency.
- **Insight**: The data reveals a slight dip in 2023 followed by a **clear rebound** in 2024. Sales, transactions, and quantity sold all increased, suggesting a **potential recovery phase** ‚Äî possibly due to post-pandemic normalization or improved consumer demand. However, additional context is needed to confirm causality.
