‚úí **Observations**:
- **Sales Recovery**: After a slight dip in 2023, total sales bounced back in 2024, reaching $524,881, increasing by 6.8% from 2023 to 2024.

üìç **Insight**: The data reveals a slight dip in 2023 followed by a **clear rebound** in 2024. Sales, transactions, and quantity sold all increased, suggesting a **potential recovery phase** ‚Äî possibly due to post-pandemic normalization or improved consumer demand. However, additional context is needed to confirm causality.

‚úí **Observations**:
- **Clear Seasonality**: Spending and transactions exhibit clear seasonal trends, with noticeable **peaks in late Q4** (Nov-Dec) and **around mid-year** ‚Äî likely aligned with holiday shopping and summer events.
