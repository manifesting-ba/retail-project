### ‚ö† Caveats:
- Partial Month (January 2025):
  - Data for January 2025 is incomplete and may distort trends or monthly comparisons. It should be excluded from time-based analysis unless specifically accounted for.
- Synthetic Data:
  - The dataset is artificially generated for analysis purposes. While it mimics real-world structures and distributions, it may not fully reflect actual customer behavior, seasonality, or market dynamics.
## üßπ Data cleaning 
The data cleaning process was performed using SQL, and the full set of queries can be found in [data_cleaning.sql](data_cleaning.sql) . 
Key steps included:
- Standardization
- Duplicates removal
- Missing value handling
The total row count after cleaning is 11,971 rows

‚úí **Observations**:
- **Sales Recovery**: After a slight dip in 2023, total sales bounced back in 2024, reaching $524,881, increasing by 6.8% from 2023 to 2024.
- **Rising Customer Activity**: Transactions and quantity sold also peaked in 2024, signaling enhanced customer engagement.
- **Stable Customer Spend**: Average spend per transaction remained stable, hovering around $130 ‚Äî this suggests growth came from increased volume and purchase frequency.

üìç **Insight**: The data reveals a slight dip in 2023 followed by a **clear rebound** in 2024. Sales, transactions, and quantity sold all increased, suggesting a **potential recovery phase** ‚Äî possibly due to post-pandemic normalization or improved consumer demand. However, additional context is needed to confirm causality.

‚úí **Observations**:
- **Clear Seasonality**: Spending and transactions exhibit clear seasonal trends, with noticeable **peaks in late Q4** (Nov-Dec) and **around mid-year** ‚Äî likely aligned with holiday shopping and summer events.
- **Post-peak Declines**: A **sharp drop follows each peak season**, especially at the **start of the year** (Jan-Feb), indicating a slowdown in consumer activity.
üí° **Recommendations**:
- **Capitalize on Peak Seasons**:
    - Launch **major promotions, product launches**, and **marketing campaigns** in late Q4 and summer months.
    - **Scale up inventory** ahead of seasonal peaks to meet demand.
    - **Increase staffing, bolster customer support**, and scale up **logistics operations** during high-demand periods to maintain service quality.
- **Counteract Post-Holiday Declines**:
    - Deploy **loyalty perks** or **"new year" sales** in January‚ÄìFebruary to sustain revenue.
    - **Adjust supply levels** in off-seasons to minimize holding costs and unsold stock.

‚úí **Observations**:
- **Butchers** and **Electric Household Essentials** stand out as **value-driven high performers**, excelling in **sales, transactions, and average spend**.
- **Furniture** shows high sales, transactions, and quantity sold with moderate average spend, suggesting it is a **volume-driven** category.
- **Food** and **Beverages** also show **high total quantities** and solid sales, suggesting they are **staple categories with steady performance**.
- **Patisserie** underperforms across most key metrics (sales, transactions, quantity) despite medium average spend, indicating a need for **pricing or promotional review**.
- **Milk Products** has relatively **high total quantity and transaction volume** but **lowest average spend** ($119.00), suggesting it's a **frequently purchased, low-margin staple**.

üí°**Recommendations**:
- **Invest in High-performing categories** (Butchers and Electric Essentials):
  - Focus promotions and advertising on these categories to maintain momentum and further boost sales
  - Introduce higher-end products to these categories to serve evolving customer needs and capture greater value
- **Boost Volume-Driven Sales with Bundles and Bulk Incentives** (Furniture and Food):
  - Offer bulk purchase discounts or bundled promotions to encourage larger purchases, improve inventory turnover, and drive profitability on frequently purchased items
  - Eg: Offer package deals (e.g., table + chairs, bed frame + mattress) to increase transaction size.
- **Reassess Pricing for Underperforming category** (Patisserie):
  - Consider new marketing campaigns, pricing adjustments, or bundling with related products to enhance competitiveness and performance
- **Bundle Low-profit category** (Milk):
  - Pair milk products with complementary goods such as cereals or cookies to increase basket size and profitability.
