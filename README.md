✒ **Observations**:
- **Sales Recovery**: After a slight dip in 2023, total sales bounced back in 2024, reaching $524,881, increasing by 6.8% from 2023 to 2024.
- **Rising Customer Activity**: Transactions and quantity sold also peaked in 2024, signaling enhanced customer engagement.
- **Stable Customer Spend**: Average spend per transaction remained stable, hovering around $130 — this suggests growth came from increased volume and purchase frequency.

📍 **Insight**: The data reveals a slight dip in 2023 followed by a **clear rebound** in 2024. Sales, transactions, and quantity sold all increased, suggesting a **potential recovery phase** — possibly due to post-pandemic normalization or improved consumer demand. However, additional context is needed to confirm causality.

✒ **Observations**:
- **Clear Seasonality**: Spending and transactions exhibit clear seasonal trends, with noticeable **peaks in late Q4** (Nov-Dec) and **around mid-year** — likely aligned with holiday shopping and summer events.
- **Post-peak Declines**: A **sharp drop follows each peak season**, especially at the **start of the year** (Jan-Feb), indicating a slowdown in consumer activity.

💡 **Recommendations**:
- **Capitalize on Peak Seasons**:
    - Launch **major promotions, product launches**, and **marketing campaigns** in late Q4 and summer months.
    - **Scale up inventory** ahead of seasonal peaks to meet demand.
    - **Increase staffing, bolster customer support**, and scale up **logistics operations** during high-demand periods to maintain service quality.
